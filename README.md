# 🎭 Celebrity Look-Alike Finder

An AI-powered web application that analyzes a user’s facial features and finds the closest matching celebrity using deep learning–based face recognition models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project allows users to upload an image and discover which celebrity they resemble.  
It uses pre-trained face recognition models to extract facial embeddings and compare them with a celebrity image database to find the best match.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads an image through the Streamlit interface  
2. Facial features are extracted using **DeepFace** models  
3. Face embeddings are compared with stored celebrity embeddings  
4. The most similar celebrity match is returned
